\title{Fuzzy Accuracy}
\usage{
fuzzyr.accuracy(f, y, f.ref = 0, scale.mase = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{f}{A vector of forecasting values produced by a model to be evaluated.}

\item{y}{A vector of observed values.}

\item{f.ref}{A vector of forecasting values produced by a benchmark method to be compared.}

\item{scale.mase}{A single value which is the scaling factor of the measure MASE.}
}
\value{
A vector of results by each measure.
}
\description{
This function is to provide performance indicators by using eight different accuracy measures including a new measure UMBRAE.
}
\examples{
f <- rnorm(10)
y <- rnorm(10)
fuzzyr.accuracy(f, y)
